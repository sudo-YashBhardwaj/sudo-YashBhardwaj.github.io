This project presents a comprehensive framework for detecting and mitigating bias in machine learning models, with a focus on gender bias in loan approval predictions. Using Python, logistic regression, and IBM's AIF360 toolkit, it identifies unfairness through metrics like Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity Difference, and group-specific error rates. The framework applies preprocessing bias mitigation methods such as Reweighting and Disparate Impact Remover, then reevaluates fairness and performance post-mitigation. Results show significant improvements in equity, reducing adverse effects on unprivileged groups, demonstrating how bias-aware modeling can promote fairer decision-making in AI systems.
