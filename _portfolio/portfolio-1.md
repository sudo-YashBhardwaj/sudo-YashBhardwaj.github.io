A production-ready research framework advancing emotion-conditioned image generation using Stable Diffusion v1.5, implementing and comparing three state-of-the-art approaches on large-scale datasets (EmoSet-118K, RAFDB). **Innovation Highlights:** (1) Developed a novel LoRA fine-tuning pipeline with learned emotion token embeddings, achieving controllable generation across 8 emotion classes (amusement, awe, contentment, excitement, anger, disgust, fear, sadness) with minimal parameter overhead (~25MB adapters vs 4GB base model), (2) Designed and trained a noise-aware latent CNN classifier (~2M parameters) that predicts emotions from intermediate diffusion latents, enabling gradient-based guidance without UNet fine-tuning—a computationally efficient alternative achieving comparable results, (3) Implemented multimodal conditioning architecture combining BLIP-generated captions with EmotionCLIP embeddings for enhanced emotion-semantic alignment. **Technical Excellence:** Built end-to-end ML pipelines including automated data preprocessing (BLIP captioning, dataset sampling/stratification), distributed training with HuggingFace Accelerate, hyperparameter optimization frameworks, and comprehensive evaluation systems using EmotionCLIP/ViT classifiers with confusion matrices and per-emotion metrics. **Engineering Best Practices:** Modular architecture supporting multiple approaches, automatic dependency resolution, CUDA-optimized inference, interactive Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, and production-ready code with error handling and fallback mechanisms. Demonstrates expertise in diffusion models, transfer learning (LoRA), gradient-based optimization, multimodal learning, and large-scale dataset management.
