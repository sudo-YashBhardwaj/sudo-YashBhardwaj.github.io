A production-ready Named Entity Recognition system using bidirectional LSTM architecture, demonstrating strong performance across general and domain-specific tasks.

**Innovation Highlights:** (1) Bi-LSTM architecture with spatial dropout and time-distributed output achieving 98% accuracy on standard NER, (2) Transfer learning pipeline fine-tuning on BC5CDR biomedical dataset achieving entity F1: 54.81% and weighted F1: 70.74%, (3) Domain adaptation techniques for robust transfer from general to biomedical text.

**Technical Excellence:** Data preprocessing pipelines, custom evaluation metrics (F1, precision, recall), and training infrastructure with early stopping and loss visualization.

**Engineering Best Practices:** Built with TensorFlow 2.0+, Keras, and production-ready code with configurable hyperparameters. Demonstrates expertise in sequence modeling, transfer learning, domain adaptation, and NLP pipelines.
