A comprehensive framework for detecting and mitigating bias in machine learning models, focusing on gender bias in loan approval predictions.

**Innovation Highlights:** (1) Multi-metric bias detection using IBM AIF360 (Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity Difference, Equalized Odds), (2) Preprocessing mitigation pipeline with Reweighting and Disparate Impact Remover techniques, (3) Quantitative evaluation framework measuring fairness improvements and performance trade-offs.

**Technical Excellence:** End-to-end workflow from detection to mitigation, systematic comparison of fairness metrics, and statistical analysis across protected groups.

**Engineering Best Practices:** Built with Python, scikit-learn, and IBM AIF360 with modular architecture. Demonstrates expertise in responsible AI, algorithmic fairness, and ethical machine learning. Results show significant equity improvements while maintaining predictive accuracy.
