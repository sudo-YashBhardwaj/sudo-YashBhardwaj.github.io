👨🏻‍🎓 I’m a master’s student in **Trustworthy & Responsible AI (TRAI)** at **[École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en)**

🔬 My research interests are at the intersection of **multimodal AI** (vision, audio and language) and **reliable/efficient LLM & VLM systems**. 

📚 I am currently collaborating with Georgia Tech’s **[Financial Services Innovation Lab](https://qcf.gatech.edu/partner)** on problems in multimodal finance.

🔎 **Actively seeking research internships (Spring/Summer 2026)** in **multimodal learning**, **alignment**, and **training LLMs/VLMs** - Europe (FR/EU) preferred, open worldwide.
> 
> I love end-to-end work: data → modeling → eval → lightweight demos.

### What I’m focused on now
- 🎥 **Multimodal learning & generation:** Video–audio–text fusion, long-range temporal reasoning, controllable generation.
- 👁️ **Computer vision:** Video understanding, detection/segmentation, retrieval, vision-language grounding.
- 🧩 **Alignment & reliability:** Preference/contrastive learning, eval pipelines, robustness/bias checks, model monitoring.
- ⚙️ **Systems & efficiency:** Memory/latency-aware inference, reproducible data/workflows, simple productizable demos.

# Selected Highlights

## Publications
- **[VideoConviction (KDD 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3711896.3737417):**  
  Introduced the first expert-annotated **multimodal finance benchmark**, capturing *conviction* in stock market recommendations from YouTube finfluencers.  
  - 6,000+ annotations across 288 videos (43 hrs), 457 annotation hours.  
  - Benchmarks LLMs and MLLMs on ticker/action/conviction extraction.  
  - Portfolio analysis shows inverse strategies (betting against finfluencers) outperform S&P 500 but with higher risk.  
  - Dataset + code released on [GitHub](https://github.com/gtfintechlab/VideoConviction) / [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gtfintechlab/VideoConviction).

- **[FinCap (ICCV 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25745):**  
  Multimodal captioning benchmark for financial videos.  
  - Generates dense captions across **video, audio, text, and descriptions**.  
  - Evaluates diverse model families (OpenAI, Gemini, Qwen, Phi, etc.).  
  - Uses **reference-free evaluation** (G-Eval, PAC-S) to assess informativeness and alignment.

### Background
- 🎓 **MSc&T Trustworthy and Responsible AI (M1)**: [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (current)  
- 🎓 **B.E., Computer Science**: [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India

### Let’s collaborate
I’m especially interested in **alignment for VLMs**, **multimodal representation learning**, **evaluation of generative models**, and **efficient training/inference**.  
If you’re building in these areas, I’d love to chat about internships or collaborations.
